## Input Strings Text File
This text is explaining the format of an input text file that can be used to provide input for a program that performs string reversal. The input file contains 5 lines, and each line corresponds to the input string for a different implementation of string reversal. For example, the first line of the input file corresponds to the input string for the first implementation of string reversal, and the second line corresponds to the input string for the second implementation of string reversal. It's important to note that the input file must contain 5 lines of text. If there are less than 5 lines, the program will stop and return an error. 


## Files
* [String.txt](./String.txt) : An example input strings text file for all 5 string reversal implementation.
