## Fifth expression of the string reversal: Recursive Function.

The fifth expression of the string reverse is implemented by using a recursive function. The function feed in a input string. If the input string has only one element, it will return the string. Otherwise, it will call the function itself again with the input of the substring without the first element. It returns the return value from the recursive function adding the first element. After finish the recursive function, the return string is going to be the reverse of the input string.
