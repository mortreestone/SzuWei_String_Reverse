## Third expression of the string reversal: Overloaded Operator.

The third expression of the string reverse is implemented by a overload operator in a structure. For the overloaded operator, I use ~ operator to do the string reversal in the mystring struct. In operator ~, I also uses method of swapping elements to reverse string. However, instead of using swap(), I hard coded the swap methoed. The result of the reversed string is stored back to the op_string;


## Files
* [expression3.h](./expression3.h) : The header file for the first expression of the string reversal. 
* [expression3.cpp](./expression3.cpp) : Main code for first expression of the string reversal.
